# ML Models & Datasets

This folder contains the machine learning models and datasets for student dropout prediction.

## Folder Structure

```
ml-models/
├── notebooks/          # Put your .ipynb files here
├── datasets/           # Put your CSV/Excel dataset files here
├── trained-models/     # Saved model files (.pkl, .joblib, .h5, etc.)
└── README.md          # This file
```

## How to Add Your Files

1. **Notebooks**: Place your Jupyter notebook files (`.ipynb`) in the `notebooks/` folder
2. **Datasets**: Place your data files (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, etc.) in the `datasets/` folder
3. **Trained Models**: Place your saved model files in the `trained-models/` folder

## Next Steps

After adding your files, we will:

1. Create a Python backend (Flask/FastAPI)
2. Load the trained models
3. Create API endpoints for predictions
4. Connect the frontend to use real predictions
