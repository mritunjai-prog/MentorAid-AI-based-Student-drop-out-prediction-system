    "\n",
    "   - Below 10: Critical risk\n",

    "4. **Age at enrollment** - 7.6% importance\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Older students (>23) may have additional challenges\n",

    "   - Dropout probability 50-70% = Schedule counseling\n",
    "   - Dropout probability 30-50% = Monitor closely\n",
    "3. **Track Progress**: Re-run predictions each semester to monitor changes\n",
    "4. **Financial Support**: Prioritize students with tuition/debt issues\n",
    "5. **Academic Support**: Focus on students with grades < 12\n",
